# Can you use a nested for loop to loop through the multidimensional list ?

"Reasearch enumerate"

# Can you use a nested for loop and enumerate through the multidimensional list?

# The enumerate object yields pairs containing a count
# (from start, which defaults to zero) and a value yielded by the iterable argument.
