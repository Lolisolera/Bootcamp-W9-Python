# Task 1
# Exercise: use the print statement to print
#print("Python is installed and working correctly in Visual Studio!")

# Your name
#print("My name is Lola")
# Your address
##print("My address is Old Farm Road, London ")
# Your interest(s)
#print("I like music and making movies ")
# Perform either addition or calculation with two numbers





# Declaring variables
#intro_message = "Python is installed and working correctly in Visual Studio!"
#name = "Lola"
#address = "Old Farm Road, London"
#interests = "My interests include music and painting"

# Displaying information using variables
#print(intro_message)
#print("My name is", name)
#print("My address is", address)
#print(interests)


#num1 = int(input("Enter your first number: "))
# JS number, Python = integer (WHOLE numbers), float (DECIMAL numbers e.g. 4.5)

#num1 = int(input("Enter your first number: "))
#num2 = int(input("Enter your second number: "))





# Task 3: using input function
# complete the rest of the code:
#num2 = int ("Enter your second number: ")) 


# Use a variable and invoke/call the input function to ask the user for a second number

# add the two numbers
##total = num1 + num2

# print out the total of the two numbers
#print(f"the total sum of {num1} + {num2} = {total}")



# convert your name , interests and city variables to become dynamic
#dynamic values  = values defined byt he user, so this can vary each time


# Input for name, interests, and city
name = input("Enter your name: ")
interests = input("Enter your interests: ")
city = input("Enter your city: ")

# Displaying the entered information
print("Name:", "name")
