In the subroutine definition, you pass in the parameter(placeholder)
In the subroutine call, you pass in the argument

    # pass the parameter inside the print statement
    print(f"My firstname is {parameterFname}")

# in the subroutine call pass in the argument that will pass into the parameterFname
